                    <h4>Digital First Design Agency</h4>
                    <p>In January 2013 Spring/Summer came to life with a clear idea of how a modern design agency could be run. Gathering the best talent fuelled by high ambitions and projects run in a way where quality is the last thing to be sacrificed, we design online shops, corporate websites and brand identities with a strong root in the Scandinavian design philosophies where functionality meets aesthetics and the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
